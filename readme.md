# PAD florijn (Development stopped)

Welcome to Project Florijn, an initiative to shine a brighter light on the Florijn Flat in the vibrant neighborhood of Bijlmer. This project leverages modern web technologies to present a more appealing image of the Florijn Flat. The application is divided into two main components: a back-end server built with Express.js and Node.js, supported by a MySQL database in Workbench, and a front-end interface constructed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (ES6+), enhanced with the power of Bootstrap 5. The project adheres to the "MVC" (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern, ensuring a structured and efficient development process.
